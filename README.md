# BinaryMessageEncoding_Test

## Overview

This repository contains a simple binary message encoding scheme implemented in C#. It is designed for use in signaling protocols for passing messages between peers in real-time communication applications. 
The encoding scheme can handle a variable number of headers, binary payload, and other specified constraints.

## Features

- Encode a message with headers and binary payload.
- Decode a binary message into a structured message object.
- Clean and production-ready code with error handling.
- Minimal and tailored design for the specified use case.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

3. Modify the `Message` and `MessageCodec` classes as needed to fit your specific application requirements.

4. Use the provided `Main` method in the `Program.cs` file to test the encoding and decoding functionality with simple test messages.

5. Customize the test messages and validation logic in the `Main` method to suit your needs.

6. Compile and run the program to see the encoding and decoding in action.

## Code Structure

- `Message.cs`: Defines the `Message` class for representing messages with headers and payload.
- `MessageCodec.cs`: Contains the `MessageCodec` class for encoding and decoding messages.
- `Program.cs`: Provides a sample program to test the encoding and decoding functionality.
